# WTDtools

Tools to read the windtunnel data from a paper by Alex Vergara and colleagues [1]. The data is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+arrays+in+open+sampling+settings) ([Direct link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00251/WTD_upload.zip)).

This repository is a stripped-down and Python 3 compatible version of `plumy`, the code that came with [2], which is [available on github](https://github.com/Huitzilo/exploiting_plume_structure).
